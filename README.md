# OpenSSL AES Encryption in C

## Description

Just an example on how to use AES for file and text encryption/decryption in C using OpenSSL.
I couldn't find much resources/manuals available for OpenSSL implementation in C,
So I made this boilerplate, hopefully this can help someone looking for something similar.

## Dependencies

> #### Requires OpenSSL
>
> Just make sure you compile with gcc `-lssl -lcrypto` flags.

## Suggested Resources
